# Welcome 👋

## About Me:
🐧My name is Mason. I am interested in Computer Vision, Signal Processing, Deep Learning, and Complexity. In this GitHub you will find projects in Python, C, and C++.

📕I am graduating from the University of Chicago in June 2022, with a BS in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning. I am double majoring in CS and Math. I am an incoming EE student at Stanford.

💎The pictures above are a sample of some of my projects. They include image-to-image translations with a Cycle Generative Adversarial Network, Object Detection and Feature mapping, creating an equalizer using C++ and the JUCE framework, and building a game in C# and Unity.

📔I am interested in doing research in Speech Recognition, Audio Scene recognition, multimodal learning, and other fields.
